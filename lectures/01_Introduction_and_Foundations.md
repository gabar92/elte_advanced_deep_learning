## Definition of NLP

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain sites at the junction of the fields of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Linguistics.
* **Computer Science**: the study of computer systems, algorithms with the goal of developing technologies and applications to solve complex problems.
* **Artificial Intelligence**: the study of creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
* **Linguistics**: the study of language and its structure, including the analysis of syntax, semantics, and more, with the aim of understanding how languages are formed, used, and change over time.

The goal of NLP: enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
* *Understanding* langauge: grasping the meaning of words, phrases, or larger units of text.
* *Interpreting* langauge: extracting deeper meaning, context, or intent in text and comprehending it.
* *Generating* text: producing human-like text

By having high-quality NLP systems:
* computers can perform a variety of tasks useful for humans
* using Natural Language humans can seamlessly and effectively communicate and instruct (API) machines
